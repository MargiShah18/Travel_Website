    <p class="description-p mt-3 container">
      Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Union territory, India. Area: 3,185 sq mi (8,249 sq km). Population: (2011) 379,944. Capital: Port Blair. It consists of two groups of islands in the Bay of Bengal about 800 mi (1,300 km) east of the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka. The chief islands are North Andaman, Middle Andaman, and South Andaman (known collectively as Great Andaman), and Little Andaman. The Nicobar group includes Car Nicobar, Camorta (Kamorta) and Nancowry, and Great Nicobar. Of the hundreds of islands that constitute the territory, the number of populated islands of the Andaman group is about double that of the Nicobar group. The territorial capital of Port Blair, on South Andaman, was established by the British in 1858.
      Although the Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory consists of hundreds of islands, very few of them are inhabited. Roughly two dozen of the Andaman Islands support human settlements, while only 12 of the Nicobar Islands are populated.

The vast majority of the population of the Andamans consists of immigrants from South Asia and their descendants. Most speak Hindi or Bengali, but Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam also are common. The indigenous inhabitants of the Andaman Islands, the Andamanese, historically comprised small isolated groups—all speaking dialects of the Andamanese language. They used the bow and the dog (introduced to the Andamans c. 1857) for hunting but knew no method of making fire. Turtles, dugongs, and fish were caught with nets or harpooned from single outrigger canoes. The remoteness of the Andamanese and their general hostility toward foreigners prevented major cultural change until the mid-20th century. Few indigenous Andamanese survive today, most groups having been decimated by disease following their encounter with Europeans, Indians, and other outsiders. In the early 21st century the only Andamanese groups that remained intact and continued to practice the ways of their ancestors included a small group of Great Andamanese on Strait Island, the Sentinelese of North Sentinel Island, the Jarawa of the interior areas of Middle and South Andaman, and the Onge of Little Andaman.

The indigenous inhabitants of the Nicobar Islands, the Nicobarese (including the related Shompen), continued to constitute the majority of the population of the Nicobars in the early 21st century. They probably descend both from the Malays of insular and peninsular Southeast Asia and from the Mon (also called the Talaing) of Myanmar. The Nicobarese speak various Nicobarese languages, which belong to the Mon-Khmer language group of the Austroasiatic language family; some also speak Hindi and English. In addition to the indigenous population, there are significant numbers of Tamils and other people from the Indian mainland living in the Nicobar Islands. Many came during the 1960s and ’70s in conjunction with the Indian government’s program to develop the region’s agriculture.

More than two-thirds of the people of the Andaman Islands are Hindu; Christians make up about one-fifth of the population and Muslims less than one-tenth. Many Nicobarese are Christian, although some communities practice local religions or have adopted Hinduism, which is prevalent throughout the region. There is also a notable Muslim minority in the Nicobars.
