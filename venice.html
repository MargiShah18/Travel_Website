          Venice Italy is an Italian city located in the northeast of the State. Venice, Venezia in Italian, is best known for its beauty, canals, architecture, and art. But there is more! This small city founded in the middle of a lagoon has been one the most powerful European States for several centuries, giving birth to a culture and lifestyle that are incredibly unique. Often called the Serenissima, after the successful government which ruled the city, Venice has been for centuries the favourite city of artists and inventors. Many habits, words, and things currently part of our daily life were born in this small but immensely important city.
          Venice is a city located in the middle of a shallow lagoon in the northeast of Italy. According to a legend, its foundation took place on the 25th of March 421 C.E.
          Since 1866 C.E., Venice is part of the Italian State.
          Venice is located in the North East of Italy, in the middle of the Venetian Lagoon at the end of the Adriatic Sea. Venice, called Venezia in Italian, is entirely surrounded by water and crossed by hundred of canals.
          A legend dates the birth of Venice back to 421 C.E. More precisely, to the 25th of March, 421.
          The growth of the city, however, only started in 812 C.E., after Carlomanâ€™s failed attempt to conquer the Venetian lagoon.
          In other words, Venice is over 1.200 years old!
          Venice became part of Italy only very recently, in 1966.
          Since 697C.E., in fact, Venice was a free and independent Republic for 1.100 years. This makes the Venetian Republic the longest-lasting form of Government in the world, ever.
          After 1.100 years, the Venetian independence ended in 1797: in May 1797, the Venetian Republic surrendered to the French army.
          Several rulers took control of Venice in the 70 years following the end of the Venetian Republic, until Venice became part of the newly formed Italian State.
